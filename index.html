  <h2>Summary of Project</h2>
  <h3>
  My AP Computer Science final was to create an object in java. I decided to make mine based on hotels because I enjoy traveling. I created a class called "Countries" -each country has a hotel- then I created another class called "Hotels". Within the hotel object, users may input values in order for the program to determine the approximate price of their stay, weather, etc. The method calcTotal calculates the users total expenditure and returns it. The countries class is more of a game. The user has a chance to win a "free" night at Ritz Carlton. To do that, they must guess the lowest price for one night at a random hotel in our list. This game is somewhat difficult since the user only has five guesses. There is another way to win a free night: you would have to enter your first and last name when prompted. The code will check whether it contains the two lucky letters, if it does, the user has won a free night at the Ritz Carlton in Tahoe. I decided to create two subclasses of hotels called Building and Skyscraper. They implement the interface called HotelRank in order to determine their tier. Overall, my goal was to allow the user to learn more about hotels and winning the free night was a bonus game.
